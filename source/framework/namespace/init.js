// This is where footwork registers its current working namespace name. Each new namespace is
// 'unshifted' and 'shifted' as they are entered and exited, keeping the most current at
// index 0.

// This counter is used when model options { autoIncrement: true } and more than one model
// having the same namespace is instantiated. This is used in the event you do not want
// multiple copies of the same model to share the same namespace (if they do share a
// namespace, they receive all of the same events/messages/commands/etc).
