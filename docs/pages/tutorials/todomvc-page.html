      <p>Getting started with footwork is best done with a real application. In this tutorial we will be covering the creation of a TODO list app.</p>
      <p>Specifically, in relation to footwork.js we will cover the following topics:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Downloading dependencies and setting up an environment to use footwork.</li>
        <li>App instantiation.</li>
        <li>RequireJS usage for automatic dependency management.</li>
        <li>&lt;viewModel&gt; wrapping of HTML and 2-way binding.</li>
        <li>&lt;custom-component&gt; creation and usage.</li>
        <li>Broadcastable and receivable usage.</li>
        <li>Routing and state initialization.</li>

      <p>This tutorial has a companion repository on github which houses the source. It is recommended (although not 100% necessary) that you follow along and
        play with the code as you progress through the tutorial.</p>

      <p>If you wish to follow along and run the tutorial code it is assumed you have a web server to host the tutorial on, and git installed. You can also optionally follow
        along by viewing the live application at the demo addresses shown at the top of each step.</p>

      <h3>You can clone the <a href="https://github.com/reflectiveSingleton/todo-tutorial" target="_blank">tutorial repo</a> with the following command:</h3>

<pre><code class="bash">git clone https://github.com/reflectiveSingleton/todo-tutorial.git</code></pre>

      <p>This repo has all of the assets needed to run the application. You may also notice it makes use of <a href="http://bower.io/" target="_blank">bower</a> for
        package management and <a href="http://lesscss.org/#client-side-usage" target="_blank">less.js</a> for CSS. It is not necessary to know anything about
        these in order to use this tutorial however they are both great tools worthy of checking out.</p>
      
      <p>For reason of brevity this tutorial will not cover the creation of the CSS/LESS, they are included for you in the repository. Also of note, the javascript runtime of
        LessCSS is used so that no re-compile step is required if/when you alter the LESS.</p>

      <div class="note"><span class="label">NOTE:</span> Do not rely on the javascript runtime of LESS when publishing your application on the internet, it is
        always recommended that you incorporate a build process in order to deply normal CSS files to a production environment.</div></p>

      <p>This tutorial assumes a basic understanding of the following topics:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
        <li>Javascript</li>

          <div class="note"><span class="label">NOTE*:</span> It is helpful if you have an understanding of
            <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/observables.html" target="_blank">knockout observables and
            2-way data binding</a>. You may be able to do without it, but if you have unanswered questions check the aforementioned documentation.</div>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>If you have questions unanswered by this tutorial consult the <a href="/api" data-bind="$route">footwork API documentation</a>. If that does not answer your question, check the <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/introduction.html" target="_blank">knockout.js documentation</a>. Footwork at
        its core is just a <span class="inline-code">superset</span> of knockout, extended from the <span class="inline-code">ko</span> object itself. Any undocumented features found in footwork are outlined there.</p>

    <div class="content">
      <p>After cloning the repository you are ready to get started, begin by checking out the <span class="inline-code">setup</span> branch:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">git checkout -f setup</code></pre>
      <p class="top"><a href="http://todo-tutorial.footworkjs.com/setup" target="_blank">Live Demo</a></p>
      <p>This will set your workspace up with the base application structure and code. Open up the page in your browser and you won't see anything too interesting just yet...but we'll get to that.</p>
      <div class="figure">
        <div class="title">Initial App View</div>
        <div class="content">
          <div class="image"><img src="images/todo-tutorial/setup0.png" alt="Base application structure" title="Base application structure"></div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>The markup itself is also nothing special, just some basic HTML:</p>
<div class="file-location">/index.html</div>
<pre><code class="html">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;!-- ... --&gt;
    &lt;script src="/bower_components/footwork/dist/footwork-all.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;

  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;main&gt;
      &lt;form&gt;
        &lt;input type="text" name="thingToDo" placeholder="What needs to be done?"&gt;
        &lt;input type="submit" value="Add Item" class="button"&gt;
      &lt;/form&gt;
      &lt;div class="todo-list"&gt;
        Nothing to do.
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/main&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

      <p>The only thing of note here is the <span class="inline-code">&lt;script&gt;</span> tag which is pulling in footwork. The path to it is mostly insignificant, just
      pointing to the bower_components folder (where bower installs footwork by default). What is significant is what build it is using, this is denoted by the postfix <span class="inline-code">-all</span>.
      This build embeds all of the dependencies footwork requires into one easy to use file. For the purposes of this tutorial we will be using this version but note that
       <a href="https://github.com/reflectiveSingleton/footwork/tree/master/dist#readme" target="_blank">others are available</a> which may fit your needs better.</p>

      <p>So what does this get us? Well we have footwork being included and some basic markup with a form to add a todo item, but no actual behavior or code to back it up. If you hit submit on the form
      it will do a normal form request which refreshes the entire page and doesn't do much else. Now it's time to bootstrap footwork and introduce the first important concept, the <span class="inline-code">&lt;viewModel&gt;.</span></p>

  <a id="base-app" class="section-anchor"></a>
  <section name="base-app">
    <div class="highlight"></div>
    <header>
      <h2 class="sub title">Base Application</h2>
    </header>
    <div class="content">
      <h3>To get the changes made in this step, run the following command:</h3>
      <pre><code class="bash">git checkout -f baseApplication</code></pre>
      <p class="top"><a href="http://todo-tutorial.footworkjs.com/bootstrapping" target="_blank">Live Demo</a></p>

      <p>Now we are ready to add some behavior to our logic-less markup and get our app started.</p>

      <p>Lets begin by creating the viewModel for our todo form. At the beginning the <a href="/api/viewModel" data-bind="$route">API documentation on viewModels</a> they are described as:</p>
      <div class="note">"A viewModel can be thought of as a container object that houses all of the logic and data with which your template/HTML/DOM binds to."</div>
      <p>With that in mind the first thing we should look after creating our base HTML is what obvious behavoirs (ie: bindings) our markup dictates we need.</p>
      
      <p>We have a form which requires the ability to take action on the provided todo text after submitting, lets go ahead and create the <span class="inline-code">viewModel</span>
        we need to express this behavior and allow for the bindings as described in our HTML:</p>
      
      <h3>The viewModel module file for the form (module which contains the forms behavior/logic):</h3>
<div class="file-location">/scripts/viewModels/TodoForm.js</div>
<pre><code class="javascript">var TodoForm = fw.viewModel({
  initialize: function() {
    this.thingToDo = fw.observable();
    this.submitForm = function() {
      console.info('TodoForm submit action triggered');
    };
  }
});</code></pre>
      <h3>Add the additional markup to bind the submit action to <span class="inline-code">submitForm</span> and value of <span class="inline-code">thingToDo</span> to the viewModel:</h3>
<div class="file-location">/index.html</div>
<pre>
<code class="html">&lt;!-- ... --&gt;
&lt;form data-bind="submit: submitForm"&gt;
  &lt;input type="text" name="thingToDo" data-bind="value: thingToDo" placeholder="What needs to be done?"&gt;
  &lt;input type="submit" value="Add Item" class="button"&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;!-- ... --&gt;</code></pre>

    <h3>And in our main application file we register the viewModel and start the app:</h3>
<div class="file-location">/scripts/app.js</div>
<pre><code class="javascript">// register the TodoForm viewModel so footwork can use it
fw.viewModels.register('TodoForm', TodoForm);

// tell footwork to startup and begin binding
fw.start();
</code></pre>

      <p>Refresh the page and we expect to have our HTML todo form bound to the Todo viewModel. But instead we get an error:</p>
      <div class="figure">
        <div class="title">Binding error:</div>
        <div class="content">
          <div class="image"><img src="images/todo-tutorial/baseApplication0.png" alt="Binding error" title="Binding error"></div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>So this is telling us it can't find the method/property for the <span class="inline-code">submit:</span> binding on our viewModel,
        why? Well we forgot one critical detail, we need to tell footwork which viewModel to bind our HTML form with. We can do this by wrapping our form
        with the <span class="inline-code">&lt;viewModel&gt;</span> declarative syntax like so:</p>

<div class="file-location">/index.html</div>
<pre><code class="html">&lt;!-- ... --&gt;
&lt;viewModel module="TodoForm"&gt;
  &lt;form data-bind="submit: submitForm"&gt;
    &lt;input type="text" name="thingToDo" data-bind="value: thingToDo" placeholder="What needs to be done?"&gt;
    &lt;input type="submit" value="Add Item" class="button"&gt;
  &lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/viewModel&gt;
&lt;!-- ... --&gt;</code></pre>

      <p>Now footwork will know which viewModel and what HTML to bind it with. Lets refresh the page once more...now there is no error, great! So lets press the <span class="inline-code">Add Item</span> button, we see the console spring to life:</p>
      <div class="figure">
        <div class="title">Binding error:</div>
        <div class="content">
          <div class="image"><img src="images/todo-tutorial/baseApplication1.png" alt="Binding error" title="Binding error"></div>
        </div>
      </div>
