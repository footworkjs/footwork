      <p>Getting started with footwork is best done with a real application. In this tutorial we will be covering the creation of a TODO list app.</p>
      <p>Specifically, in relation to footwork.js we will cover the following topics:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Downloading dependencies and setting up an environment to use footwork.</li>
        <li>App instantiation.</li>
        <li>RequireJS usage for automatic dependency management.</li>
        <li>&lt;viewModel&gt; wrapping of HTML and 2-way binding.</li>
        <li>&lt;custom-component&gt; creation and usage.</li>
        <li>Broadcastable and receivable usage.</li>
        <li>Routing and state initialization.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This tutorial has a companion repository on github which houses the source. It is recommended (although not 100% necessary) that you follow along and
      play with the code as you progress through the tutorial.</p>
      <p>This section will not cover setting up a webservice or basic git usage (beyond the few commands needed to use the tutorial). If you are new to git,
      I would recommend taking a look at the <a href="https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1" target="_blank">walk-through</a> available on github.</p>
      <h3>You can clone the <a href="https://github.com/reflectiveSingleton/todo-tutorial" target="_blank">tutorial repo</a> with the following command:</h3>
<pre><code class="bash">git clone https://github.com/reflectiveSingleton/todo-tutorial.git</code></pre>
      <p>This repo has all of the assets needed to run the application. You may notice it also makes use of bower <a href="http://bower.io/" target="_blank">bower</a> for
      package management, and <a href="http://lesscss.org/#client-side-usage" target="_blank">less.js</a> for CSS. It is not necessary to know anything about
      these in order to use this tutorial however they are both great tools worthy of checking out.</p>

      <p>This tutorial assumes a basic understanding of the following topics:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
        <li>Javascript</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Although not required, it is helpful if you have knowledge of any of the dependencies footwork uses, most notably knockout. You shouldn't have <em>too much</em> issue
      getting through the tutorial without it, but having an idea of how to use <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/observables.html" target="_blank">observables and
      2-way data binding</a> at the least would be helpful.</p>
      
      <p>This tutorial will not cover the creation of the CSS/LESS, they are included for you in the base repository. Also of note, the javascript runtime of
      LessCSS is used so that it needs no re-compile step if/when you alter it.</p>

    <div class="content">
      <p>After cloning the repository you are ready to get started, begin by checking out the <span class="inline-code">setup</span> step branch:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">git checkout -f setup</code></pre>
      <p>This will set your workspace up with the base application structure and code. Open up the page in your browser and you won't see anything too interesting just yet...but we'll get to that.</p>
