      <p>Getting started with footwork is best done with a real application. In this tutorial we will be covering the creation of a TODO list app.</p>
      <p>Specifically, in relation to footwork.js we will cover the following topics:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Downloading dependencies and setting up an environment to use footwork.</li>
        <li>App instantiation.</li>
        <li>RequireJS usage for automatic dependency management.</li>
        <li>&lt;viewModel&gt; wrapping of HTML and 2-way binding.</li>
        <li>&lt;custom-component&gt; creation and usage.</li>
        <li>Broadcastable and receivable usage.</li>
        <li>Routing and state initialization.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This tutorial has a companion repository on github which houses the source. It is recommended (although not 100% necessary) that you follow along and
        play with the code as you progress through the tutorial.</p>

      <p>If you wish to follow along and run the tutorial code it is assumed you have a web server to host the tutorial on, and git installed. You can also optionally follow
        along by viewing the live application at the demo addresses shown at the top of each step.</p>

      <h3>You can clone the <a href="https://github.com/reflectiveSingleton/todo-tutorial" target="_blank">tutorial repo</a> with the following command:</h3>

<pre><code class="bash">git clone https://github.com/reflectiveSingleton/todo-tutorial.git</code></pre>

      <p>This repo has all of the assets needed to run the application. You may also notice it makes use of <a href="http://bower.io/" target="_blank">bower</a> for
        package management and <a href="http://lesscss.org/#client-side-usage" target="_blank">less.js</a> for CSS. It is not necessary to know anything about
        these in order to use this tutorial however they are both great tools worthy of checking out.</p>
      
      <p>For reason of brevity this tutorial will not cover the creation of the CSS/LESS, they are included for you in the repository. Also of note, the javascript runtime of
        LessCSS is used so that no re-compile step is required if/when you alter the LESS.</p>

      <div class="note"><span class="label">NOTE:</span> Do not rely on the javascript runtime of LESS when publishing your application on the internet, it is
        always recommended that you incorporate a build process in order to deply normal CSS files to a production environment.</div></p>

      <p>This tutorial assumes a basic understanding of the following topics:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
        <li>Javascript</li>
        <li>
          <p><a href="http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/observables.html" target="_blank">Knockout.js observables and data-binding</a>*</p>
          <div class="note"><span class="label">NOTE*:</span> It is helpful if you have an understanding of
            <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/observables.html" target="_blank">knockout observables and
            2-way data binding</a>. You may be able to do without it, but if you have unanswered questions check the aforementioned documentation.</div>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Generally when in doubt, check the <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/introduction.html" target="_blank">knockout.js documentation</a>. Footwork at
        its core is just a <span class="inline-code">superset</span> of knockout, extended from the <span class="inline-code">ko</span> object itself.</p>

      <p>After cloning the repository you are ready to get started, begin by checking out the <span class="inline-code">setup</span> branch:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">git checkout -f setup</code></pre>
      <p>This will set your workspace up with the base application structure and code. Open up the page in your browser and you won't see anything too interesting just yet...but we'll get to that.</p>
