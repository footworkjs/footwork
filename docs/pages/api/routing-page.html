      <p>Routing in a web application is about managing state. Modern single-page web applications make use of the HTML5 <span class="inline-code">history</span>
      API in order to retain normal browser navigation while not forcing a complete refresh of the page on every change. Footwork incorporates 
      <a href="https://github.com/browserstate/history.js/" target="_blank">history.js</a> to help smooth over the browser history API inconsistencies.</p>
      <p>The router included with footwork has a few key features:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Unlimited nesting of routers.</li>
        <li>Unlimited named dynamic view outlets per router.</li>
        <li>Context based sub-routing.</li>
        <li>Filtered/predicate based routes.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In essence the included router in footwork combines several design patterns (MVC + MVVM + Observable) and context-based subrouting to provide a novel and extremely powerful routing solution.</p>

      <p>Routers have two principle components which make them useful:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Routing configuration/definition used to define routes, controllers, and their actions.</li>
        <li><span class="inline-code">&lt;outlet name=""&gt;&lt;/outlet&gt;</span> declarations which are the output points your router controls.</li>

      <p>Routers are incorporated into <a href="/api/viewModel" data-bind="$route">footwork viewModels</a> and are a part of their <a href="/api/viewModel#configuration" data-bind="$route">configuration</a> definition.</p>

      <p>viewModels 'wrap' a section of your DOM, providing the binding points and logic for that section of your HTML. In a similar sense a router provides all routing logic for that section of the DOM. If anywhere within in the DOM there is an 
      <span class="inline-code">&lt;outlet name=""&gt;&lt;/outlet&gt;</span> declaration, footwork will travel up the element node path searching for the nearest parent viewModel which has a router. That router is able to control what view/component
      is displayed at any one time in any <span class="inline-code">&lt;outlet name=""&gt;&lt;/outlet&gt;</span> declarations found within its scope.</p>
