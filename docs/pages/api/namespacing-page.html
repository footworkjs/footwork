      <p>Namespaces in footwork can be thought of as communication 'channels'. They are the information highways your application uses to shuffle data and state from one area to another.</p>
      <p>Organizing your modules and keeping them decoupled is extremely important in more complex javascript applications. Without a standardized way of coordinating information, an application
      will quickly turn into to a horrible tangled mess of code. This tangled mess becomes a buggy unmanageable piece of poo...no one likes to touch poo.</p>
      <p>Footwork marshals all of that by organizing your modules firstly by namespaces. Namespaces boil down to a simple <span class="inline-code">'string'</span> value which is used to segment off
      the communication meant for one module from another. Footwork uses this namespacing to provide a lot of enhanced functionality via 
      <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html" target="_blank" title="Command Query Responsibility Segregation">CQRS</a> and other common communications design patterns.</p>
      <h3>All of this essentially means is that the communication between your modules/viewModels/components/<em>whatever</em> will be both expressive and easily managed.</h3>

      If you need to enhance or alter how communication is handled then you likely want to take a look at the postal documentation.</div>

      <p>There are essentially 2 different ways a namespace can be used:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>In tandem with a viewModel/component, automatically initialized and disposed of for you.</li>
        <li>Independently/Manually instantiated by you and <em>sometimes</em> disposed of for you.</li>
