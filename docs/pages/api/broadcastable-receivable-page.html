      <p>The broadcastable and receivable functionality provides for an easy to way to share data, state, and more between two different areas of your code.</p>
      <p>They enable a variables in one viewModel/module to be reflected in the variable of another, being kept in sync automatically and transparently to you. By taking advantage of this functionality
      your application and modules are able to expressively share state and data while being kept as loosely coupled (<em>and testable!</em>) as possible.</p>
      <p>Broadcastables and receivables are extended/special knockout observables which hook into the namespacing provided by footwork to either send data (broadcastable) or receive data (receivable) to or from other namespaces/modules. They
      can be used just like any other knockout observable as they extend from the base <span class="inline-code">ko.subscribable</span> type.</p>
      <div class="note"><span class="label">NOTE:</span> Broadcastables and receivables are integrated with (and make most sense when used with) <a href="/api/viewModel" data-bind="$route">footwork viewModels</a> but they can also be used independently.</div>

      <p>Broadcastables are created by taking an observable and calling <span class="inline-code">observable.broadcastAs()</span> on it, receivables are created by taking an observable and calling <span class="inline-code">observable.receivFrom()</span> on it. Broadcastables and receivables can be based off of any knockout observable type (observable, computed observable, observableArray).</p>
      <div class="note"><span class="label">NOTE:</span> Receivables must be 'writable' (when receiving data from a broadcastable, the observable it is based off of must be able to be written to). This means that if you have a computed observable you are calling <span class="inline-code">.broadcastAs()</span> on, it must have a <span class="inline-code">write:</span> method specified.</div>
      <p>Receivables are listeners for information that a broadcastable sends out. Anytime a <span class="inline-code">broadcastable</span> send out an updated value for the variable a <span class="inline-code">receivable</span> is configured for, the receivable will be updated, its listeners notified, and propagate through any computed values as expected.</p>
      <p>The module a broadcastable is attached to should be thought of as the 'owner' of that property, and any related logic should (ideally) also be contained within that module/lexical scope.</p>
      <p>Since receivables and broadcastables are just extended observables, any computed properties and subscriptions based off of them will propagate just like normal knockout observables.</p>
      <div class="note"><span class="label">NOTE:</span> Because of their reliance on the message bus, broadcastables and receivables must be cleaned up when disposing of them. Any broadcastable or receivable which is assigned to a viewModel will automatically be cleaned up along with that viewModel. If you are using them independently, you will need to call <span class="inline-code">observable.dispose()</span> when you intend to get rid of it.</div>

      <p>Broadcastable values can be either read-only or writable. A writable broadcastable will allow a receivable to
          write back its value upstream. This means you can have a value broadcast from one namespace/module and allow a receivable to both listen for and update its value (with that value propogating back to the broadcaster).</p>
      <div class="note"><p><span class="label">NOTE:</span> Although broadcastables can be writable, try to avoid writing to them from external modules. The broadcastable should ideally have associated 
        logic contained within the module it is attached to. 'Reaching in' from an external location breaks the concept of separation of concerns and can lead to spaghettification of your code.</p>
      </div>
      <h3 class="top">Read-only Examples:</h3>
<pre><code class="javascript">var User = fw.viewModel({
  namespace: 'User',
  initialize: function(username) {
    // broadcastAs() will use the namespace of the viewModel by default.
    this.username = fw.observable(username).broadcastAs('username');
  }
});

// You can also be explicit or broadcast on a different namespace
var appUsername = fw.observable(username).broadcastAs({ name: 'username', namespace: 'Application' });
// Note: Try to keep broadcastables located within their respective module
//       (ie: try not to broadcast to a different namespace than the current one, this is mostly
//            for use outside of a viewModel context)

// receivable listening for updates on 'username' from the 'User' namespace
var userName = fw.observable(null).receiveFrom('User', 'username');
// userName() === null

// create user object that broadcasts 'username'
var user = new User('Jonathan');
// ...and now the receivable is updated by the broadcastable:
// userName() === 'Jonathan'</code></pre>
      <div class="note"><span class="label">NOTE:</span> It does not matter if the broadcastable or receivable is created first:
        <ul>
          <li>As soon as the broadcastable is instantiated any receivables listening will be updated with the current value.</li>
          <li>As soon as a receivable is instantiated it will request the current value from the broadcastable. If no broadcastable is present for the receivable, no change to the receivables default will be made.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h3>Writable example:</h3>
<pre><code class="javascript">var User = fw.viewModel({
  namespace: 'User',
  initialize: function() {
    // Writable broadcastable, can be written to by a receivable
    this.browserType = fw.observable('unknown').broadcastAs('browserType', true);
    this.browserType.subscribe(function(browserType) {
      // a normal subscription to updates on the observable this.browserType
      if(browserType === 'Internet Explorer 6') {
        console.log('I am sorry, we do not support ancient technologies.');
      }
    });
  }
});
var user = new User(); // create a user using the viewModel declaration from above
// user.browserType() === 'unknown'

/**
 * Create the receivable which is tied to the 'browserType' variable on the 'User'
 * namespace. The default (null) provided is overwritten when the receivable is
 * initialized and the (already initialized) broadcastable responds with the current value.
 */
var userBrowserType = fw.observable(null).receiveFrom('User', 'browserType');
// userBrowserType() === 'unknown'

/**
 * When you make an update/write to a receivable, it will try to write that back
 * to the broadcastable, if (and only if) that broadcastable is writable it will be
 * listening for any updates and act accordingly, updating its own value, informing any
 * listeners, and propogating through any computed values.
 *
 * If the broadcastable is not writable then the requestable will only be overwritten
 * locally. The requestable will also be overwritten again if/when the broadcastable send
 * out another value.
 */
userBrowserType('Internet Explorer 6');
