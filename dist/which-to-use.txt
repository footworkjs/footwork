NOTE: All of these releases may be used via all common script loaders
      including requireJS (AMD) and Browserify (CommonJS). It is
      important that the names used for the modules match the ones given

Common Questions:

Why multiple build profiles?
    Some people have projects that already incorporate these
    dependencies. The footwork-all.js build while convenient, embeds
    all of these for you. If your project uses these dependencies
    separately from footwork then you do not want them also being
    embedded into footwork. These other (lighter) builds do not include
    those as embedded dependencies and you will need to provide them
    yourself.

I need a different build, can I make others?
    Well sure, the gulpfile.js is in the repo:
    https://github.com/reflectiveSingleton/footwork
    [TODO]: Make documentation concerning custom builds.
    I also accept pull requests, so if you think your build would help
    out others as well, please feel free to submit a pull.
